## 💡 Overview / Motivation

**DTSAQuestions** is a Swift-based repository that brings together a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems, each carefully implemented and documented in **Xcode Playgrounds**.  
It’s designed for developers who want to **practice problem-solving**, **prepare for technical interviews**, or **deepen their understanding of core computer science concepts** — all while using the expressive and modern syntax of Swift.

Each Playground page contains:
- A **problem description** at the top 🧩  
- A **clean, commented Swift solution** below 💻  
- Optional **complexity analysis** and **alternative approaches** ⚙️  

This project aims to provide a _clear, idiomatic, and educational reference_ for algorithmic thinking in Swift.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Curated collection of classic algorithm & data structure questions  
- 📘 Written entirely in **Swift Playgrounds** for easy experimentation  
- 🧠 Covers a wide range of topics:
  - Arrays & Strings  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Stacks & Queues  
  - Trees & Graphs  
  - Dynamic Programming  
  - Searching & Sorting  
- 💬 Each question includes explanation, reasoning, and time/space complexity  
- 🧩 Perfect for interview preparation and self-study

## 🧭 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS with **Xcode 15+**
- Basic familiarity with Swift syntax
- Curiosity for algorithms 😉

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ariobarxan/DTSAQuestions.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open DTSAQuestions/DTSAQuestions.playground
   ```

### Usage
- Navigate through the **Playground pages** in the left sidebar.
- Each page represents a **separate problem** with its **solution** and **analysis**.
- Experiment with inputs, modify logic, and observe the results live in Xcode.

> 💡 Tip: Use Xcode’s live execution and inline results to test different cases instantly.
